# Monitoring Contracts

We can monitor any contract that is deployed to a network and has a Truffle artifact file. To start monitoring, click <span class="inline-menu-item"><i class="fas fa-table"></i>DATA</span> in the sidebar and then the <span class="inline-button">UPLOAD ARTIFACT FILES</span> button in the upper right.
