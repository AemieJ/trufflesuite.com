# Creating an Account

To start, navigate to <a href="https://my.truffleteams.com" target="_blank">https://my.truffleteams.com</a> (this link will open in a new window).

If you're not already logged in to your GitHub account, Github will prompt you to do so.

Once logged in, you'll be asked for permission to link Truffle Teams to one or more of your GitHub repositories. Select the repositories you wish to add and click continue. We can always add a repo later if necessary. See the [Linking Repositories](/docs/teams/getting-started/linking-repositories) documentation for more informaiton.

We arrive at the home screen and see the repos we've added--let's commit some code and see how Truffle Teams will automatically run our tests!
