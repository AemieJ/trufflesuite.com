## The Proverbial Coin

I wake up pinching myself every morning as I walk downstairs from my bedroom to my office for my morning commute. Two whole flights of stairs. It’s rough. I pinch myself because I am incredibly fortunate to head partnerships for Truffle Blockchain Group. It’s been a dream job and I’m constantly energized by the people I work within the blockchain industry. Since joining the crypto ecosystem, I’ve witnessed both sides of the proverbial coin which represents both the hype and historic feats of blockchain technology. Unfortunately, the hype makes for much better stories.

It’s easy to remember the tea company that added “blockchain” into their name and subsequently tripled their stock price. I can’t think of another emerging technology that is at the bleeding edge of financial innovation, yet also deals with bearer assets. Millions of individuals have seen their assets explode in value only to consequently lose them from poorly managed private keys or the hack of a prominent exchange.

## The Other Side of The ERC20 Token

Many individuals and spectators only ever read about the hype side of the coin. They flipped it once and gave up. Working in emerging technology demands that you flip the coin every day. As a result, I have seen the other side of the coin and it is historic.

I have sat down with (or at least had video conference calls with) so many household brand name companies I have lost count. What started out as “excuse me, *insert incredibly impressive company name here* wants to talk with me?” has now become my new normal.

I have seen the genuine interest and desire to better our technical futures from some of the best and brightest minds in the enterprise world. People who understand that the early stages of a new technology revolution are not easy or always perfect on the 1st, 2nd, or maybe even 728th attempt. But with determination, hard work, and our incredible minds working together the promise of a web 3 future is achievable.

But these are just sentiments. Let me provide you with some concrete examples of real-world “non-hype” uses of distributed ledger technology.

## The Real World Use Cases

### Supply Chain

[Treum](https://treum.io/) has used the Ethereum blockchain to track the freshness of products, present consumers where products are sourced, and enable for faster recalls and notifications of faulty products.

Cargo Community Network (CCN), a leading provider of cargo community systems for the air cargo industry has [partnered with Microsoft](https://news.microsoft.com/en-sg/2019/03/13/cargo-community-network-partners-with-microsoft-to-launch-the-worlds-first-blockchain-air-cargo-billing-costing-and-reconciliation-system/?ocid=AID725565_TWITTER_oo_spl100000480864708) to introduce the world’s first blockchain-based air cargo billing, costing and reconciliation system.

Starbucks is [working with Microsoft](https://news.microsoft.com/transform/starbucks-turns-to-technology-to-brew-up-a-more-personal-connection-with-its-customers/) to harness its Azure Blockchain Service in tracking coffee shipments from across the world, bringing “digital, real-time traceability” to its supply chains.

### Finance

The World Bank launched bond-i (blockchain operated new debt instrument), the world’s first bond to be created, allocated, transferred and managed through its life cycle using distributed ledger technology.

### Gaming

Microsoft [deployed a blockchain-based solution](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/microsoft-financial-operations-professional-services-azure) to offer royalty information to Xbox game publishers in near real-time, it dramatically lowered statement access times from 45 days to just minutes.

### Many More to Come

There are so many other stories that I am privy to with my position in the ecosystem that I wish I could share, but Truffle, NDAs, and our partners/clients deserve to have their moment when they are ready to enter the limelight. Until then, I’ll continue to appreciate being able to work in the most exciting industry surrounded by the best people at the best company in the world.

As a teaser, you can be a part of some of the above mentioned really cool announcements by joining us at TruffleCon 2019 August 2-4 where because of our sponsors we were able to lower the ticket price to only $99. Hundreds of developers, community members, and enthusiasts are going to be in one place. We have done our best to take away any excuse to come. If you can think of another one send it my way inquiry@trufflesuite.com, and I will try and figure out a way to overcome that one as well. See you all live and in-person in a little under a month in Redmond WA!
